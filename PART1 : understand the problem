# 01 Type of the problem
The goal of sub-challenge 2 (SC2) of the DREAM Preterm Birth Prediction Challenge is to determine how accurately the maternal whole blood transcriptome from two or more samples collected during pregnancy (17-36 weeks) in asymptomatic women, can predict preterm birth.
 
Participants are required to develop parsimonious models (at most 100 total unique genes can be involved) to make two sets of predictions for all individuals in the test set. The first set of predictions will classify individuals in the test set as sPTD vs Control, while the second prediction will classify individuals as PPROM vs Control.
